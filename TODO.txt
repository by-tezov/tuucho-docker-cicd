# TODO docker
    - source all variable in single file to make it easier to setup somewhere else instead of fetching entrypoint by entrypoint
    - env variable system should come from docker env instead of duplicate conf (aka path builder env, +node path), mayeb a way to inject them in jenkins ?
    - todo agent-repository for (report, apk, app, ipa)
